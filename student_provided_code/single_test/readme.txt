I'm running lots of ad hoc tests, and finding the testing script slightly cumbersome. 

Here's a script that runs just one test case:

 

$ python test_single.py 1 estimate
$ python test_single.py 3 navigate

 

You can mess with the params dict if you want to add custom tests, following the examples in testing_suite_full.py (see GLOBAL_PARAMETERS)

 

Disclaimer: use at your own risk. So far the "estimate" mode seems to work OK, I haven't checked navigation yet.
